                Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt,where such game board have
                been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.

                An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was
                called
                terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only
                three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.The game's grid markingshave
                been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is three men's morris which is
                also
                played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish,and Picaria, a game of the
                Puebloans.

                The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "noughts and crosses"
                (nought
                being an alternative word for 'zero'), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and
                Queries.The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred
                to "a
                children's game played on a slate, consisting of trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on
                one
                of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored"."Tic-tac-toe" may
                also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558.
                The USrenaming of "noughts and crosses" to "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.

                In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the
                EDSAC
                computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games.The computer
                player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

                In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy
                elements. The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe
                perfectly.It is currently on display at the Computer History Museum.
